# miniqueue

A minimalist generic multi-threaded queue that aggregates results and populates the queue with more tasks.

The semantics are the opposite of `fold`/`reduce`: instead of starting with a bunch of data, it starts with a single data point and recursively traverses it to unfold a bigger structure.

It is useful when working with dependency graphs. It can be used by compilers, package managers and linkers/bundlers.

## Usage

Here's a simple example:

```rust
let all_results = miniqueue::run(first_job, |job| {
    let (result, more_jobs) = run_job(job)
    (result, more_jobs)
});
```

Pass the first **job** that should be run as the first parameter.

The second parameter is a closure that receives the **job** and executes it, and should return a tuple containing:

 - The **job result**
 - A vector with more **jobs** to be executed in the next iterations

All the **jobs** returned in the vector will be enqueued to be executed later. Notice that jobs that were already executed in the past will not be scheduled again.

The end result of `run` itself is a HashMap aggregating **jobs** and **job results**.

Both the **job** and **job result** are generic types, so they can be anything you want.

Here's a test case with a self-contained example:

```rust
use miniqueue;

let result = run(1, |num| {
    match num {
        1 => Ok(("one", vec![ 2 ])),
        2 => Ok(("two", vec![])),
        _ => Ok(("", vec![]))
    }
});

assert_eq!(result.unwrap().get(&1), Some(&"one"));
```
